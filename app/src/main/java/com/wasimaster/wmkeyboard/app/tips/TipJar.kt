/**
 * Tips through Google Play billing, as the Supporters screen sees them.
 *
 * The Play build may not link to SupportKori: Play's Payments policy lets an
 * app take money only through Play's own billing, tax-exempt charities aside.
 * So that build sells the tiers below as consumable one-time products, and
 * every other build keeps the SupportKori link and never links Play Billing
 * at all, which F-Droid would refuse.
 *
 * Same seam as the updater: the interface is here so the screen compiles
 * everywhere, `src/play/java` drives Google's BillingClient, and
 * `src/noplay/java` returns [NoTipJar]. Exactly one of the two is compiled.
