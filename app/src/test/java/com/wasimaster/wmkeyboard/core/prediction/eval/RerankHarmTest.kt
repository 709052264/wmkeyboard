/**
 * The counterweight to `RerankGainTest`: what the context reranker COSTS.
 *
 * Gain is measured on cases where the population prior happens to be right,
 * which is the easy half of the question and the only half the existing
 * harnesses ask. `RerankGainTest`'s random-context corpus cannot ask the other
 * half — a random previous word means the seed term almost never fires, so a
 * "0/1000 lists changed" reading is the reranker staying silent, not the
 * reranker being safe.
 *
 * This corpus is built to make it speak and be wrong. Each case types a real
 * dictionary word **correctly**, choosing one that sits an edit away from a
 * common follower of the preceding word. "hello" primes "world"; the user
 * types "words". Nothing is misspelled, so the right answer is unambiguous and
 * any drop in top1 is the prior burying a word the user actually typed.
 *
 * The number this prints is the one to weigh a cap change against. A reranker
 * cap is a trade, and a trade needs both sides measured.
