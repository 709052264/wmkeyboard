# FUTO Swipe on real swipes

The FUTO Swipe glide engine's decoder (`wm-engine`'s `glide::ctc`) measured on
FUTO's MIT-licensed swipe.futo.org strokes, with the model's emissions
computed once in Python so the decoder can be iterated on in Rust.

1. Fetch the data and the models (MIT dataset, FUTO Model Weights License 1.0
   for the weights; nothing here is committed):

   ```bash
   curl -L -o test.jsonl https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/resolve/d71bf5fd/test.jsonl
   curl -L -o qwerty.json https://huggingface.co/datasets/futo-org/swipe.futo.org/resolve/d71bf5fd/swipe-5/layouts/qwerty.json
   R=18328c3042b066952c0936b3771d492fe2ec289a
   curl -L -o honorable_sturgeon_model_fp32.pte https://huggingface.co/futo-org/futo-swipe/resolve/$R/honorable_sturgeon/model_fp32.pte
   curl -L -o magic_macaw_model_fp32.pte https://huggingface.co/futo-org/futo-swipe/resolve/$R/magic_macaw/model_fp32.pte
   ```

2. A Python with `executorch` 1.5.1 and `torch` (`uv venv && uv pip install executorch torch numpy`).

3. Emissions, as the app computes them (`SwipeFrame.features`, the encoder, the
   decoder): `python -I emit.py test.jsonl qwerty.json <models dir> test.bin`.
   `loopify.py` redraws strokes with a loop on the doubled key (or a stray one
   on a word with none), `truncate.py` cuts strokes of 6+ letters at a share
   of their length; both write jsonl for `emit.py`.

4. `cargo run --release --example ctc_glide_eval -- test.bin ../../app/dictionaries-src/en.txt [mode]`
   from `native/wm-engine`; the example's header lists the modes.

Measured 2026-10-21 (bundled en.txt, 38,049 test swipes whose word it holds):

| | top-1 | top-4 |
|---|---|---|
| bare decoder | .9562 | .9921 |
| loops (weight 2) | .9562 | .9921 |
| look-ahead, Eager margin (cost 0.5) | .9560 | .9921 |
| learned shapes (weight 10) | .9564 | .9921 |

| subset | without | with |
|---|---|---|
| doubled key redrawn with a loop (3,055) | .9437 | .9460 |
| stray loop on a word with no double (4,485) | .8954 | .8939 |
| cut at 70% of the path (4,619), top-1 | .068 | .120 |
| cut at 50% (4,619), top-1 | .0004 | .038 |
| drawn before in the session (8,656) | .9812 | .9841 |
| not drawn before (29,393) | .9488 | .9482 |

Dropped: pause and wiggle marks (charging words that skip a paused key cost
0.3 point of top-1 at weight 1 and 2.3 at weight 3: the model reads timing
itself), the broad loop charge GlideBeam uses (+0.6 on looped doubles but
−1 to −9 points on stray loops), and learned-shape seeding (.9564 to .9552).

## GlideBeam on the same strokes

`GlideRealSwipeEval` in `:app`'s tests runs the built-in decoder over the
same files: `WM_FUTO_DIR=<folder with qwerty.json and the jsonl files>
./gradlew :app:testIntlDebugUnitTest --tests "*GlideRealSwipeEval"`. Measured
2026-10-22 on the first 8,000 test strokes over the bundled en.txt, before and
after #886 (the doubling charge cut to 0.05 + 0.1, loops cut out of the shape
channel, the stroke's ends open past the gap band):

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| all strokes (6,052) | .7740 | .7791 |
| short words with a doubled letter (81) | .1975 | .6543 |
| doubled key redrawn with a loop (482) | .7552 | .8154 |
| stray loop on a word with no double (4,385) | .8041 | .7977 |
