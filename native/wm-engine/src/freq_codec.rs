//! The 16-bit minifloat `.wmdict` and `.wmng` store frequencies and counts
//! in: a 5-bit exponent and an 11-bit mantissa with an implicit leading bit.
//!
//! Exact below 2048, which covers every absolute threshold the engine tests
//! against and most of a bundled word list; above that the relative error is
//! at most 1/2048. Monotone in the raw bit pattern, so quantising can never
//! reverse two frequencies, only tie ones within 0.05% of each other, and
//! `round(max(fs)) == max(round(f))`: a subtree maximum stays exact rather
//! than becoming a loose bound, which is what the branch-and-bound completion
//! relies on.
