/**
 * Reads a chat screenshot into messages, for a model that cannot see (#234).
 *
 * The provider the user has chosen may take pictures, in which case it reads
 * the screenshot itself and this is never called. When it cannot — an
 * on-device model, Brave, DeepSeek, or a user who asked for it to stay on the
 * device — the words still have to get there somehow, and this is that route.
 *
 * ## Who said what
 *
 * OCR gives back lines and boxes, and the thing that actually says who wrote a
 * message is which side of the screen its bubble sits on. So the side is the
 * guess: a line whose box sits past [ReplyOcrLines.MINE_FROM] of the width is
 * the user's own.
 * It is only a guess — a centred system notice, a wide bubble, a tablet layout
 * all defeat it — so the panel draws the label on every line and a tap flips
 * it. Being able to fix it is the feature; being right most of the time is the
 * convenience.
