/**
 * The navigation bar's insets as the keyboard window last dispatched them to
 * the keyboard's frame, kept apart from Compose's own
 * `WindowInsets.navigationBars` (issues #463, #468).
 *
 * Compose's insets listener stopped taking new insets after the keyboard was
 * switched away and back, and the bottom row then sat on the gesture handle
 * and the system's keyboard buttons. Holding back the insets animations that
 * leave it waiting (see [StableMeasureFrame]) was not enough on every phone.
 * So the keyboard's frame records the insets the view hierarchy is handed,
 * which no listener state can get stuck in front of, and asks for a fresh
 * dispatch when it is attached or the window comes back on screen.
 *
 * Only the dispatched insets, the same ones a View with fitsSystemWindows
 * pads by (HeliBoard's keyboard view): the window's raw `rootWindowInsets`
 * count a bar that something above the keyboard has already padded for, and
 * reading those gave a row-high gap under the space bar (#569).
 *
 * Plain pixels, like the platform's own insets.
