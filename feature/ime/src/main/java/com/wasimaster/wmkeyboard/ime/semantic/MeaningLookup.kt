/**
 * Search by meaning for the AI tools: one query against the clipboard, notes
 * or snippets index [MeaningSearch] keeps (`search_clipboard`, and the meaning
 * halves of `search_notes` and `search_snippets`), each item checked against
 * its store as it is now.
 *
 * The indexes are only as fresh as the last time their panel opened, so
 * the stores are the word on what may be read: a clip that has since been
 * marked a password, a note locked or put in the trash since, or anything
 * deleted, is dropped even though its vector is still there. A clip that
 * reads as a password or a one-time code is dropped too, marked or not:
 * with the clipboard's sensitive handling on Keep nothing is marked, and a
 * model has no business reading those either way.
 *
 * Pure apart from what it is handed, so a test can give it a fake embedder.
