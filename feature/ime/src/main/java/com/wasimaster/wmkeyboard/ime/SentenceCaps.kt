 * The one exception the keyboard makes to the field's own sentence caps: a full

 *
 * Android's caps mode (`TextUtils.getCapsMode`) looks back past closing quotes
 * and brackets to the mark in front of them, so `An "exclamation!" is` armed
 * shift for "is" as though a new sentence had begun. The mark ended the quoted
 * words, not the sentence around them. When the quotation is the whole
 * sentence, the next word does start a new one, and the caps stay:
 * `"Stop!" Then she left.`
