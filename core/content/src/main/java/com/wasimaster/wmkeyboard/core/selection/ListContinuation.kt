/**
 * Enter on a list line in any app (#694): the next line starts with the next
 * marker, the way the Notes editor already does it (`NotesLogic.enter` in the
 * IME). `- `, `* `, `+ ` and `• ` carry on as they are, `1. ` and `1) ` count
 * on, a Markdown task box (`- [x] `) carries on as an empty one, and so does
 * a `☐ ` box.
 *
 * Enter on an item with nothing in it ends the list instead: the marker goes
 * and no line break is typed, which is how every editor lets you out of one.
 *
 * Numbers stop at three digits so a line that opens with a year (`2024. was
 * long`) is not read as item two thousand and twenty-four.
