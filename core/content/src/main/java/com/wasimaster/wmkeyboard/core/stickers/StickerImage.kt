/**
 * Turns an arbitrary picked image into sticker bytes.
 *
 * Still images become WebP in their own shape, scaled down to
 * [MAX_STILL_SIZE] on the long edge and never up. They used to be letterboxed
 * into WhatsApp's 512×512 square on the way in, which put an empty band
 * beside every picture that was not square, everywhere it was sent. Only
 * WhatsApp and Messenger ask for that square, so only a send to them gets
 * it: see [squareCopy], and
 * [com.wasimaster.wmkeyboard.core.media.MediaMime.needsSquareSticker] for
 * which sends that is.
 *
 * Animated GIF and WebP sources are stored byte for byte instead: re-encoding
 * one would cost a generation of quality for nothing. An animated WebP that
 * already meets the spec therefore still goes out as a sticker; an animated
 * GIF can only ever be sent as an image.
 *
 * An animated PNG is the exception, because nothing on Android plays one and
 * no app takes one as a sticker. Its frames are read with [ApngFrames], each
 * is encoded as a still WebP by the platform, and [AnimatedWebpWriter] wraps
 * those into one animated WebP, which is both.
 *
 * Telegram's two animated kinds go the same way: a `.tgs` (a gzipped Lottie
 * animation) is drawn frame by frame with [TgsFrames], and a `.webm` video
 * sticker is decoded, transparency and all, with [WebmFrames].
