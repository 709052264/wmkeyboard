 * The user's personal vocabulary: words they have typed and the bigrams,

 * completion, next-word prediction and the context reranker.
 *
 * Persisted as JSON in app-private storage. All typing data stays on
 * device; [clear] wipes it for the privacy setting.
 *
 * The store is Rust (`wm-engine`'s `user_lexicon`, which WMK Desktop runs
 * too, behind [PredictionNative]'s `lex*` calls): the counts, the learning
 * rules (the case vote, the follower cap, compaction by decayed count) and
 * the file's format, and on a load the folding and judging of the words the
 * file holds. This class folds each word a caller passes to the key every
 * store files it under ([WordKey]), judges which words may be learned at all
 * ([WordContext.isLearnableWord]), and owns the file itself ([SnapshotFile]'s
 * atomic writes). Every method takes a word in any spelling, as before.
 *
 * Thread-safe: the Rust store sits behind a read-write lock, and the
 * operations that span several calls (load, save, reload, clear) hold this
 * object's monitor as the Kotlin store's did.
