/**
 * The letter grid a glide is drawn on: every character the layout can produce,
 * resolved to the key that produces it.
 *
 * Two things separate this from the raw [KeyCenter] list it is built from.
 *
 * **Several characters share one key.** On Latin that is only case — `a` and
 * `A` are one key — but it is the general rule, not a Latin quirk. Probhat puts
 * ক and খ on one key, ঞ behind a long press on another; QWERTZ hides ü behind
 * u. A finger crossing a key cannot say which of its characters was meant, so
 * all of them resolve to the same centre and the language model separates them
 * afterwards. Refusing the shifted characters instead would make every aspirated
 * Bengali consonant unglidable, which is most of the language.
 *
 * **Lookup is boxing-free.** The decoder resolves an edge label to a key for
 * every trie edge it considers — hundreds of thousands of times per decode — so
 * the map is a sorted [IntArray] searched by bisection rather than a
 * `HashMap<Int, Int>`, whose keys would box on every probe for any character
 * outside the cached ASCII range (which is to say, every non-Latin script).
 *
 * Keyed by code point, not `Char`, so a letter outside the BMP — every Osage,
 * Adlam or Warang Citi key — is one entry and not two halves of one. The `Char`
 * overloads answer for a single UTF-16 unit and say no to a lone surrogate,
 * which is never a character the grid could produce.
 *
 * Coordinates are in key widths, the convention shared with `KeyTouchModel`, so
 * nothing downstream depends on density or keyboard size.
