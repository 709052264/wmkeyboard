/**
 * The context reranker: a deterministic interpolated n-gram rescorer over the
 * engine's top candidates, built entirely from data the keyboard already has
 * — the user's learned bigrams, trigrams and skip-grams, the corpus pack, the
 * bundled seed-pair counts (which the strip's own ranking never read), and
 * the last few committed words as a topical recency bag. No network, no
 * model file.
 *
 * Where the engine's in-strip context boost is deliberately capped (a habit
 * may re-rank but never bury a frequent exact match), this pass — opt-in per
 * call — rescores the head of the list with the full interpolated
 * evidence. It returns null whenever no candidate has any
 * context evidence at all, which is the common case and means the engine's
 * order stands untouched; a reorder can therefore only ever be
 * evidence-driven.
 *
 * The scoring runs in Rust (`wm-engine`'s `rerank`), next to the lexicon and
 * the packs it reads, in one call per strip. This side does what needs the
 * JVM: lower-casing and folding the words ([WordKey]), the seed pairs, and
 * whether the previous word is one no dictionary knows, which lets the word
 * before it vouch through its own pairs instead.
