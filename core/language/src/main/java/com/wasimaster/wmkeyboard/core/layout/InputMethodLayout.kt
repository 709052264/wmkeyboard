 * layout's keys type.
 *
 * The same shape as [KeymanBinding], for the same reason: a layout is data and
 * has to decode on a device that does not have the method's files, so only the
 * name travels. An exported layout stays small, and where the files are missing
 * the grid types its own key caps. `:core:input` looks the binding up; nothing
 * here depends on it.
 *
 * [kind] is stored beside the id so the keyboard knows how to treat the keys
 * (choose from a strip, or compose in place) before the files have been read,
 * which happens off the main thread.
