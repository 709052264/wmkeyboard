/**
 * Reverse-phonetic lookup for the [IndicPhonetic] languages: [HindiPhoneticIndex]'s
 * fold, reached through Devanagari.
 *
 * Every word of the list is spelled in Devanagari ([IndicScript.toDevanagari]:
 * the blocks are parallel, so that is a shift and a handful of script-specific
 * signs) and filed by the Hindi fold, which already forgets everything a
 * romanized spelling of any of these languages leaves out — aspiration, dental
 * against retroflex, vowel length, the inherent vowel, conjuncts — and keeps
 * as detail what it can rank by. A lookup answers in the list's own script,
 * because the fold remembers which word each Devanagari spelling came from.
 *
 * What a language adds ([IndicProfiles]):
 *
 *  - [romanPrep], its romanization's habits rewritten into the spelling the
 *    Hindi fold expects. Tamil writes no voiced stops, so "ganga" has to ask
 *    for the k that கங்கா folds to; "zh" is the Tamil and Malayalam ழ / ഴ,
 *    which the fold files under l.
 *  - [devanagariPrep], the same done to the list's words, where a distinction
 *    has to go from both sides (Malayalam's voicing).
 *  - [rerankBy], the rules' own reading, for a list with no frequencies: the
 *    fold's ties are then broken by how close each candidate is to what the
 *    rules spell — a better prior than none when the list ranks every word the
 *    same and is full of tokens that only share a key with the real word.
