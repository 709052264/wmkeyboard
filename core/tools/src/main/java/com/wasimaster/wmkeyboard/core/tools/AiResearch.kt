/**
 * Deep research: a question answered from the web, step by step, with every
 * page it read numbered and cited.
 *
 * Not a tool loop the model drives. A model left to search for itself stops
 * after one search, or searches the same thing five times, and cites pages it
 * never read. Here the steps are fixed and bounded and only the judgement in
 * each is the model's:
 *
 * 1. **Plan.** The model breaks the question into sub-questions, from the
 *    general to the specific, and gives each its searches. The plan is a
 *    checklist the chat shows, ticked as each sub-question is covered, and
 *    the user may be asked to approve it before anything is searched.
 * 2. **Gather.** One sub-question at a time: its searches, then the best of
 *    their results, spread across sites, are read.
 * 3. **Look again.** With what was read in front of it, the model names what is
 *    still missing as new searches, each a new item on the checklist, or says
 *    it has enough. Back to 2, up to [Limits.rounds] times in all.
 * 4. **Write.** The model writes the report from the numbered sources, a
 *    section for each sub-question, citing them as `[n]`; the list of sources
 *    it cited is added under it here, not by the model, so every link in it
 *    is one that was really read.
 *
 * Every step is reported to [listener] as an [AiToolActivity] — the plan, a
 * search, a page read — which is what the chat already draws as its chain of
 * steps, so a report shows what it was built on in the same way a tool call
 * does. [isActive] is asked between steps: Stop ends the run at the next one.
 *
 * Pure: the model and the web come in through [model] and [web], so the whole
 * run can be tested with neither, and run on the JVM against real ones.
