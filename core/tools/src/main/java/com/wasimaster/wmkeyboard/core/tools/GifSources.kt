 * [COMMONS] is the F-Droid build's only remote source and appears in no other

 * rather than leaving the user to conclude the search is broken.
 *
 * [GIFCITIES] is the Internet Archive's search over old GeoCities GIFs. It
 * needs no key, so any build can offer it, but only once the user turns it
 * on: the corpus is a curiosity rather than a reaction-GIF catalogue, and it
