/**
 * Turns the lines OCR read off a chat screenshot into messages (#234).
 *
 * Pure, so it is testable without ML Kit: the recognizer hands over lines and
 * their boxes, and everything that decides what a *message* is happens here.
 *
 * Three jobs, in order:
 *
 * 1. **Crop.** A screenshot taken with the keyboard up has the keyboard in it —
 *    the reply panel's own buttons and notices, read back as "what they said".
 *    The caller passes where the keyboard started ([ReplyOcrFrame.bottomCut])
 *    when it knows, and the status bar and app bar ([ReplyOcrFrame.topCut]).
 * 2. **Drop chrome.** Times, "Active now", "Seen", the composer's "Message"
 *    placeholder: words on the screen that nobody said ([isChrome]).
 * 3. **Group.** A bubble that wraps is two OCR lines. Lines on the same side
 *    that sit closer than a bubble's own padding are one message. What this
 *    gets wrong the panel lets the user merge by hand.
