/**
 * The AI reply tool (#234): drafting an answer to something somebody else
 * wrote.
 *
 * ## Why this is not just another AI action
 *
 * Every action in [BuiltInAiActions] transforms text the user has already
 * typed. A reply works on text the user has *not* typed and cannot select —
 * the other person's message lives in the app above the keyboard, which an
 * input method cannot read. So this file carries two things the actions do
 * not need: a way to say where the other person's words came from
 * ([ReplySource]), and a conversation rather than one blob ([ReplyTurn]).
 *
 * The second difference is a safety one. An action's input is the user's own
 * writing; a reply's input is a stranger's. Everything here is therefore
 * untrusted data, and [AiPrompts.replyPrompt] frames it as such.
