/**
 * The seam between search by meaning and the LiteRT interpreter that runs
 * EmbeddingGemma 2's graphs. [EmbeddingEngine] reaches the implementation,
 * `LitertEmbeddingRuntime`, only by reflection (see
 * [SemanticModule.BRIDGE_CLASS]), because the class lives in a different place
 * per channel, exactly as Whisper's, the sticker cutout's and PaddleOCR's do:
 *
 * - Play builds: in the on-demand `:feature:litert` module.
 * - Every other build with LiteRT: compiled into `:core:intelligence` (the
 *   `src/semanticbridge` source directory), the interpreter itself delivered
 *   as a pinned library where the build delivers them.
 *
 * Only the graphs run on the other side; tokens, the token table and the
 * picture's patches are [EmbeddingInput] on this side. No type here may come
 * from LiteRT. Not safe to share between threads.
