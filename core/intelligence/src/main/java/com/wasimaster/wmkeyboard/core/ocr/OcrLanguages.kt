 * Packs are the `tessdata_fast` models: LSTM only, which is all the slimmed
 * engine in `native/tesseract-jni` can run, and about a quarter of the size of
 * `tessdata_best`. A pack is named by Tesseract's own code (`ben`, `chi_sim`),
 * and several keyboard languages can share one: both Norwegians read with
 * `nor`, and a language without a pack of its own reads with the main pack for
 * its script, so Maithili gets Hindi's Devanagari model.
 *
 * Chinese and Japanese can also read with PaddleOCR, whose one pack
 * ([PaddleOcrModel.PACK]) covers both and reads them far better than
 * tessdata_fast; see [offlinePack]. Its recognizer reads Latin script too,
 * which F-Droid's build, with neither ML Kit nor Tesseract, falls back on.
 *
 * Never a catalogue on its own: the lists the user sees come from their
 * enabled languages through [packsFor].
