/**
 * The upscaler's pixel arithmetic, apart from Android and from MNN so it can
 * be tested on the computer: cutting a picture into tiles, feeding one to the
 * network, and putting what comes back where it belongs.
 *
 * Pixels are non-premultiplied ARGB ints, which is what `Bitmap.getPixels`
 * hands over. The network sees RGB from 0 to 1 in NCHW order.
 *
 * A tile is read with [UpscaleModels.CONTEXT] pixels of the picture around
 * it (the picture's own edge pixel repeated past its border), which the
 * network eats, so tile seams fall where the network could see across them.
 * Every tile has the same input size, the last row and column included: MNN
 * prepares a network for one input shape and redoes that for each new one.
