/**
 * PaddleOCR's PP-OCRv5 mobile models, the scanner's reader for Chinese and
 * Japanese wherever ML Kit's recognizers for them are missing (#757):
 * sideload builds, Play builds on phones without Play services, and F-Droid's
 * build, which has no ML Kit at all and reads Latin script with it too.
 *
 * One recognizer covers Simplified and Traditional Chinese, Japanese kana and
 * kanji, and English, so the whole set is a single pack, [PACK], in
 * [OcrPacks]: a text detector, a line recognizer and the recognizer's
 * character list. None of it is in the APK.
 *
 * The two graphs come in one format per [Runtime], and a build downloads only
 * its own:
 * - [Runtime.LITERT], wherever LiteRT is in the build: the conversions
 *   published with iFleey's PPOCRv5-Android (Apache-2.0, as are
 *   PaddlePaddle's weights), pinned to one commit.
 * - [Runtime.MNN], in F-Droid's build, which may carry nothing of Google's:
 *   PaddlePaddle's own weights exported to MNN by the data repository's
 *   `scripts/export_ppocrv5_mnn.py`, with their float16 rounding matched to
 *   the LiteRT pair's, so both read the same text. They run on the MNN
 *   library the sticker generator brings (see [MnnPaddleRuntime]).
 *
 * Every file is checked against its SHA-256, because a graph that loads but
 * is not the expected one would read garbage rather than fail. Inputs are
 * fixed: a 640 pixel square for the detector and a 48 by 320 strip for the
 * recognizer, which [PaddleOcrPipeline] fits every photo and line to.
